WoW 360 is little more than a keyboard to controler mapper.  It doesn't allow for anything you couldn't already do by clicking a couple of buttons in game.

It will not automate processes that can't already be done with a macro. In fact it really works best when used with in game contitional macros to give each button a multi-facited task.

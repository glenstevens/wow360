# Introduction #

I will try to get the details for previous revisions in here eventually, but it's not my priority.

# Release 2.1 #
  * Recompiled to run in 32 bit as a work around for Windows Vista & 7. The DirectX driver that we attach to is only available for 32 bit.

# [Revision 21](https://code.google.com/p/wow360/source/detail?r=21) #
  * Added a UseTildeForAutorun switch, make it false if you use NumLock.
  * Added an AssistMode switch, if set to false, it won't assist party members when selecting them.
  * Cleaned up the Space bar code.
  * Added a target friendly (Hold right trigger and press left shoulder to cycle through friendly targets).
  * Changed the D-Pad functions to support Shift-Up and -Down through action bars.
